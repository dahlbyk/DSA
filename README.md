# Code Challenge 1: Reverse An Array

## Problem Domain
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a new array with elements from input array in reversed order.

## Approach and Efficiency
We set a counter to index through our new array and a for loop that iterated through our input array, and as we iterated through the for loop we increased the counter and decreased.

## Solution

# Code Challenge 2: 

## Problem Domain
Insert a value at the middle index of an array and shift the values.

## Approach and Efficiency
The approach I took has a linear time space complexity, in that it must iterate over the entire input array, and create a new array of the input array plus one, therefore making it n^2 O(n)

# Code Challenge 3:

## Problem Domain
Perform a binary search in a 1d sorted array

## Approach and Efficiency
The approach I took has a time space complexity of O(log n).
