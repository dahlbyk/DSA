# Code Challenge 1: Reverse An Array

## Problem Domain
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a new array with elements from input array in reversed order.

## Approach and Efficiency
We set a counter to index through our new array and a for loop that iterated through our input array, and as we iterated through the for loop we increased the counter and decreased.
