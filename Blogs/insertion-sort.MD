# Code Challenge 26: Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts each element one at a time by comparing it with the elements that already exist in the array that it is being sorted in, and shifting those existing elements that are greater than the element to be sorted so that it can be inserted. This is repeated until the entire list is sorted.
